    "### 1. Bagging \n",
    "Bagging (also known as **B**ootstrap **Agg**regation) often considers homogeneous weak learners, learns them independently from each other in parallel and combines them following some kind of deterministic averaging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap is a sampling technique in which we select “n” observations out of a population of “n” observations. But the selection is entirely random, i.e., each observation can be chosen from the original population so that each observation is equally likely to be selected in each iteration of the bootstrapping process. After the bootstrapped samples are formed, separate models are trained with the bootstrapped samples. In real experiments, the bootstrapped samples are drawn from the training set, and the sub-models are tested using the testing set. The final output prediction is combined across the projections of all the sub-models.\n",

    "Boosting is a form of sequential learning technique. The algorithm works by training a model with the entire training set, and subsequent models are constructed by fitting the residual error values of the initial model. In this way, Boosting attempts to give higher weight to those observations that were poorly estimated by the previous model. Once the sequence of the models are created the predictions made by models are weighted by their accuracy scores and the results are combined to create a final estimation. Models that are typically used in Boosting technique are XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine), ADABoost (Adaptive Boosting), etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, it is not true that it will always perform better. There are several ensemble methods, each with its own advantages/weaknesses. Which one to use and then depends on the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have models with high variance (they over-fit your data), then you are likely to benefit from using bagging. If you have biased models, it is better to combine them with Boosting. There are also different strategies to form ensembles. The topic is just too broad to cover it in one answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the point is: if you use the wrong ensemble method for your setting, you are not going to do better. For example, using Bagging with a biased model is not going to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you need to work in a probabilistic setting, ensemble methods may not work either. It is known that Boosting (in its most popular forms like AdaBoost) delivers poor probability estimates. That is, if you would like to have a model that allows you to reason about your data, not only classification, you might be better off with a graphical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this post, you got introduced to Ensemble learning technique. You covered its basics, how it improves your model's performance. You covered its three main types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you implemented these three types in Python with the help of scikit-learn, and in this course of action, you gained a bit of knowledge about the necessary preprocessing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's quite a feat! Well done! In this final section, I suggest some further undertakings on Ensembles which you might want to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Take it further:**\n",
    "* Try other Boosting-based Ensemble techniques viz. Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.\n",
    "* Play with the different parameter settings that scikit-learn offers in Ensembles and then try to find why a particular setting performed well. This will make your understanding even stronger. link\n",
    "* Try Ensemble learning on a variety of datasets to understand where you should and where you should not apply Ensemble learning. For finding datasets Kaggle, UCI Repository, etc. are good places to search."
